# JavaScript

## History
JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. 

## What made it popular?
JavaScript, abbreviated as JS, is a flexible and widely used programming language that has remained popular for decades. Its appeal stems from its ability to bring online applications to life, generate dynamic user experiences, and function across several platforms.

## Influence
avaScript empowers web developers to craft responsive, interactive, and user-friendly applications. It endows websites with the ability to validate user inputs in real-time, provide live updates without necessitating page reloads, and enchant visitors with seamless animations and transitions.

## What languages inspired JavaScript?
JavaScript is a multi-paradigm, dynamic language with types and operators, standard built-in objects, and methods. Its syntax is based on the Java and C languages â€” many structures from those languages apply to JavaScript as well.
